1)values are- 'hello',-87.8,6    expression are-*,-,/,+


2)A variable is basically the name of the location in the primary memory of your computer. A string is a literal text string, i.e. 'Hello'    A variable can hold a string, but a string can't hold a variable ,  A variable can store everything from strings to numbers. A string is the values inside the quotes assigned to a string.

3)Numbers:
  Number stores numeric values. The integer, float, and complex values belong to a Python Numbers data-type. 
String:
The string can be defined as the sequence of characters represented in the quotation marks. In Python, we can use single, double, or triple quotes to define a string.

List:
Python Lists are similar to arrays in C. However, the list can contain data of different types.


4)An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.len is a built-in Python function that returns the number of characters in a string. We’ve previously seen the print and the type functions, so this is our third example of a function!

The evaluation of an expression produces a value, which is why expressions can appear on the right hand side of assignment statements. A value all by itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable. Evaluating a variable gives the value that the variable refers to.

5)A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We have only seen the assignment statement so far. Some other kinds of statements that we’ll see shortly are while statements, for statements, if statements, and import statements. (There are other kinds too!)

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.

6)variable bacon contain 23

8)a variable name can only be a character or sequence of character but 100 is a numeric value it cant be a variable

9)The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value

10)cause of error -TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

correct code-   print("I have eaten {} burritos".format(99))
